## Architecture
MovieCorns uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. This pattern separates the data (model) from the UI (view), and uses a view model to communicate between them. The advantage of this pattern is that it promotes separation of concerns and testability.

## Networking
MovieCorns uses RestAPI to fetch movie data from the internet.
